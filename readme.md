## Commands
In freegamesbot.py I have used a prefix of "Â¤", this symbol however can be changed to anything or even removed entirely. The prefix indicates that a commands need to have that symbol at the start to be considered a command. <br>
The commands are as following: <br>

* helpme

Sends out a message on how to use the main command

* ping

This command just checks if the bot have connection to the discord server

Sends out a list of five games from the last seven days from the subreddit [```FreeGameFindings```](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeGameFindings/)

These commands can be changed and there is possibility to add commands in the code
